Hi there,

We are interested in becoming a publishing partner.  We have a huge variety of websites and mobile Apps which we are looking to monetize.  Our audience is currently US based, however we are in the midst of growing our user base to other English speaking Geos (UK, Canada, Australia, etc.)  I would love to learn more about your product offering to understand if there is a fit in either Desktop/Mobile banner/video/rich media we can work on together.

Please advise on how we can proceed.  I look forward to hearing from you.  

 

Best Regards,
Anung
