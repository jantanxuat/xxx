It feels like just yesterday we got the iPhone 7s, but the <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="http://www.seventeen.com/life/tech-social-media/news/a39940/the-iphone-8-might-be-entirely-made-out-of-glass/" target="_blank" data-tracking-id="recirc-text-link">rumors about the iPhone 8</a> are already swirling. Technology! Who can keep up!?


<div class="standard-article-body--text">
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">Well, the answer is: Lots of people. And they have some guesses as to what computers we're gonna be carrying around in our pockets this time next year. <em data-redactor-tag="em"><a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="https://www.thrillist.com/tech/nation/iphone-8-rumors-curved-screen-specs" target="_blank">Thrillist</a></em> reached out to a variety of Apple experts, and they have some informed guesses as to what's up with the iPhone 8.</p>

<div class="ad-gpt-breaker-container"></div>
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">Here's what they're are saying: It'll be available in three different models of varying sizes, images will "pop" better on screen, the home button is no more, and wireless charging.</p>
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">And, perhaps most fascinatingly, there are these two tidbits:</p>

<h4 class="question body-el-question standard-body-el-question anim-in-view">The screen will be curved:</h4>
<blockquote class="body-blockquote body-el-blockquote standard-body-el-blockquote anim-in-view in-view">The overwhelming majority of iPhone 8 speculators believe it will feature a massive redesign. Most notably, the screen <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/28/curved-screen-iphone-2017-wsj/" target="_blank">will be "bent" on either side</a>, much like those on the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or Note7 (RIP). Furthermore, both the front and back sides <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/the-iphone-8-will-feature-glass-covers" target="_blank">could be covered in glass</a> and connected via a metal frame, much like they were in the iPhone 4 and 4s models. Here's hoping the company manages to make it crack-proof this time.</blockquote>
<h4 class="question body-el-question standard-body-el-question anim-in-view in-view">And, it'll have eye- and face-scanning technology:</h4>
<blockquote class="body-blockquote body-el-blockquote standard-body-el-blockquote anim-in-view in-view">The introduction of Touch ID on the iPhone 5s ushered in a whole new level of mobile security and convenience, but Apple plans to bump its biometrics integration up a notch or two. One rumor, prompted by a leak from a Chinese chip manufacturer, <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/08/31/latest-rumor-pegs-secure-iris-scanner-for-apples-2017-iphone" target="_blank">suggests</a> the next iPhone will feature iris-scanning technology. That means you might be able to unlock your phone, or pay for stuff via Apple Pay, just by looking into a little camera on the screen. Considering Apple's also acquired a number of companies that specialize in facial recognition in recent years, some speculate it may also come equipped with face-scanning tech, which would open the door to a whole bunch of new and exciting features and be a huge boon for the advancement of augmented reality.</blockquote>
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">That's some straight-up <em data-redactor-tag="em">Mission Impossible</em>-style stuff! And I both love it and am terrified of it. Bring it on, Apple.</p>
